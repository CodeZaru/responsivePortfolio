							<p>I started out as a sponge brained baby, as does everybody.  Curious and creative, I explored the natural world. Then came the indoctrination into social organizations and structures: pre-K through higher education and the transition from school to career.  No wonder those who survive this process end up at the top of the food chain.</p>

							<p>We’ve all been through it in various forms, but we don’t end up in the same places.  My quick summary will shed a little light on who I am today.</p>

							<p>I'd say that I started out as a right-brained fellow when I was a wee lad, excelled in kindergarten, then stumbled painfully through elementary school where creativity (in my generation of schooling) was stifled.  I eventually evolved to discovered that math made much more sense to me than poetry, formulas were much more fun to memorize than vocabulary words, and that I have a horrible singing voice.  High School was a short and sweet adventure in life, so I went back for a second helping after college, only this time as a teacher at a local public high school.  If anybody asks, I spent 8 years in high school.</p>

							<p>
								In college, my right brain and left brain collaborated and I landed somewhere in the middle brain, majoring in International Area Studies with a concentration in Japanese language.  Spending a couple years in Japan along the way, I became fluent in the Japanese written and spoken language, and gained a good cultural understanding too.  After my four-year stint as a high school teacher, I went back to school and earned an MBA.  Spent about 8 years in the Corporate Finance and Accounting arena, mostly in the private sector.  The Finance guys in the Planning and Reporting departments like to be creative, and the bean counters in the Accounting department prefer not to be creative, nor do they appreciate the creativity of the Planning guys.  Who would have thought that corporations have right and left brains by department like that.</p>

								<p>My journey has taught me that one should never stop learning and evolving.  I aspire to be balance-brained, malleable, and ever evolving and flourishing.  Happily, I ended up in a career that has the ultimate right-left combination of creativity and logic: IT Project Manager and Developer.  I've spent the last 14 years as an IT Project Manager, working with developers and cultivating my own programming skills along the way.  
								</p>

								<p>Even though we might be happy where we are, we need always to be open to the prospect of new adventures  that add the 'X' factor to spice up our lives and experiences, and ensure that we evolve to our fullest potential.</p>
